Calculator Application
==========
This is a Calculator application implemented in java using Software Engineering tools and Agile Software Development. 
I have developed this calculator following TDD and the GUI implements MVC design pattern. 

The calculator has two functionalities to calculate the value of the string. One is Infix method of evaluating the string
and the other is Reverse Polish method of evaluating the stirng. The Graphical interface has a entry field where the user 
can enter the expression. He also has two radio buttons to chose between Reverse Polish and Infix method of calculation. 
There is also a calculate button when clicked it evaluates the expression and displays it on the screen. An InvalidExpression 
alert is raised when a sutiable expression is not entered into the GUI.I used different types of stack implementation in this 
for the evaluation of the string in Reverse Polish and Infix algorithms.
